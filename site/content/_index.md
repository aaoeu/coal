  heading: What is this site?
  text: >-
    You're not going to believe this, but the content is stored in plain text
    (Markdown). It's deployed (turned into static HTML) using a program called
    Hugo. But then, there is this other layer that makes it easy to edit this in
    the browser. Which is kind of blowing my mind.
intro:
  heading: So I can edit this in plain text?
  text: >-
    If you really want to. It's stored on GitHub. But this in-browser editor
    called "Netlify" makes it easy to edit the text while seeing a preview. Like
    this:
values:
 - heading: "Single origin"
    text: >-
      Single-origin coffee is coffee grown within a single known
      geographic origin. Sometimes, this is a single farm or a
      specific collection of beans from a single country. The name of
      the coffee is then usually the place it was grown to whatever
      degree available.

  - heading: "Our values"
    text: >-
      Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one
      of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We
      want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
      exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
