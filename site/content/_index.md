blurb:
  heading: What is this site?
  text: >-
    This is an example of what you can do these days with a static site
    generator. The content is stored in plain text (Markdown). It's deployed
    (turned into static HTML) using a program called Hugo. But then, there is
    this other layer called NetlifyCMS that makes it easy to edit this in the
    browser. Which is kind of blowing my mind.
intro:
  heading: So I can edit this in plain text?

    If you really want to. It's stored on GitHub. But there's an in-browser
    editor called "Netlify" makes it easy to edit the text while seeing a
    preview.

      Here's what this page looks like when you edit it in a browser. You can
      edit in plain text, but see the preview instantly in the right pane. It's
      all client-side Javascript so it's really, really responsive.

  heading: Why is there a picture of a guy picking coffee berries?
  text: >-
    Because when you deploy a site, it starts with this random content about
    coffee. Including the random logo and the blog posts below. And because it's
    the Era of GDPR, I haven't gotten much farther than just deploying the site.


    But still. Free domain, free site, no security updates ever ... pretty
    awesome.
